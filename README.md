<td>This project was created by engineers from <a href="https://andersenlab.com/">Andersen Software Inc</a>
which were motivated by the idea to describe the graphs of the main knowledge/skills
of different types of engineers which in turn provides a way to develop these graphs
by the community and by the approach which engineers prefer.</td>
