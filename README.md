# Engineers Roadmaps

![Andersen Logo](logo.png)

This project was created by engineers from [Andersen Software Inc.](https://andersenlab.com/)
by idea to describe the graphs of the main knowledge of
different types of engineers and provides a way to develop these graphs
by the community and by the approach which engineers like.

## Roadmaps

### Golang

- [Materials](stacks/go/data/roadmap.svg)
- [DOT](stacks/go/data/roadmap.dot) version
- [XML](stacks/go/roadmap.xml) and [python script](roadmap/tools/xmlgraph.py) for them

### Java

* You have installed the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* You also have installed [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/)
* And you have a basic understanding of graph theory

### Work
All changes should be developed in the feature branch and merge throw the merge request
Also, you have to update the project each time you change any XML file by:
```bash
make all
