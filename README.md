# Golang Software Engineer Roadmap

At the beginning, this roadmap was written in [DOT language](roadmap.deprecated.dot) and converted by [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).
But later it has been rewritten in [GraphML](stacks/go/roadmap.xml).

There is also [markdown version](stacks/go/data/roadmap.md).

Improvements are welcomed.
